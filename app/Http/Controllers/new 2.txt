	1. limit operations per user type
	2. add admin operations (add, edit, delete, approve users)
	3. change what the news, research, and publications show
	4. populate data with data from original website (especially faculty)
	5. create thumbnail generator for faculty (just in case image is not portrait size)
	6. make default faculty image (for those that do not have an image)
	7. Add sort and search features for news, research, publications, and dashboard viewalls
	8. redesign the website to look more like a mobile app.
