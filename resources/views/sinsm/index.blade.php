					The Summer Institute in the Natural Sciences and Mathematics (SINSM) is an annual extension service of the College of Science. Since 1990, we had trained and updated secondary and tertiary teachers on the latest development in theory, applications and pedagogy, as well as refresher courses in the basic concepts in the fields of Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, and recently in Sports Science. Our service is inspired by the very objectives of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in its desire to inculcate academic excellence in the teaching of Science and Mathematics-allied degree programs by strongly encouraging the conduct of lectures and seminar workshops that promote interest in and awareness of developments in the basic and advanced Sciences and Mathematics, together with the Department of Educationâ€™s (DepEd) objectives to establish and maintain a complete, adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.
